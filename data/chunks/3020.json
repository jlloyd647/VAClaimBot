McDonald\n, 28 Vet.App. 158 (2016), held that the final sentence of\n38 CFR 4.59\nrequires that certain ROM testing be conducted to assess for pain whenever possible in evaluating joint disabilities.  Particularly,\nthe joints involved must be tested for pain\non both active and passive motion, and\nin weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing, and\nthe ROM of the opposite, undamaged joint must be assessed for comparison, if possible.\nCorreia\nalso held that pain with passive motion, and not just active motion, warrants entitlement to the minimum compensable evaluation under\n38 CFR 4.59\n.\nNote\n:  If the examiner cannot assess the motion of the opposite, undamaged joint,\nand an opposite joint does exist\n, the examiner should explain why the assessment is not possible.  Examples of situations in which ROM of the opposite, undamaged joint cannot be assessed for comparison include (but are not limited to) the\nspinal disabilities, since there is no opposite joint\ndisabilities wherein the opposite, undamaged joint has been amputated, or\ndisabilities wherein the opposite joint is damaged or disabled and would not be an effective comparison to ascertain the degree of impairment of the SC joint.\nImpact on application of\n38 CFR 4.59\n:\nExaminations must address the\nCorreia\ncriteria.\nAssign the minimum compensable evaluation when there is evidence of painful motion with\nactive or passive motion, and/or\nwith weight-bearing or nonweight-bearing.\nPrior to the\nCorreia\nholding, longstanding Veterans Benefits Administration policy was that only pain with active motion triggers application of\n38 CFR 4.59\n.\nThe\nCorreia\nholding is effective July 5, 2016.",
