Derwinski\n, 1 Vet.App. 584 (1991), 513 U.S. 115(1994), the US Supreme Court held that\n38 U.S.C. 1151\nimposed only a causation requirement and did not authorize VA to establish an additional requirement for a showing of fault.\nPL 104-204,\nSection 422, amended the causation standard for claims under\n38 U.S.C. 1151\nto include a fault element.\nPrior to October 1, 1997, a showing of VA fault or failure to exercise reasonable skill and care is not an element of establishing causation for entitlement to\n38 U.S.C. 1151\nbenefits.  Statutory language imposed the requirement of a causal connection only between the injury or aggravation of an injury and hospitalization, medical or surgical treatment, or the pursuit of a course of vocational rehabilitation.  This standard of causation is discussed in\n38 CFR 3.358\n.\nOn or after October 1, 1997, an additional fault element was added under\n38 CFR 3.361\n, requiring that the evidence show that additional disability or death was caused by either\nan event not reasonably foreseeable, or\ncarelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault.\nReference\n:  For more information on the revision of causation to include the addition of the fault requirement, see\nGardner v. Derwinski\n, 1 Vet.App. 584 (1991), 513 U.S. 115(1994)\nPL 104-204,\nSection 422, and\nVAOPGCPREC 5-2001\n.",
