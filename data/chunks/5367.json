Nicholson\n, 21 Vet.App. 174, 182 (2007).  The determination of whether an examination is warranted is made on a case-by-case basis primarily focused on whether the evidence of record is adequate for rating purposes in accordance with\n38 CFR 3.326\nand, irrespective of age, accurately reflects the overall disability picture.\nReference\n:  For more information on when medical evidence is adequate for rating purposes, see\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 1.A\n.",
