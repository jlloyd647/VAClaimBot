Principi\n, 237 F. 3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001), where there is sufficient medical evidence establishing that the alcohol or drug abuse disability is secondary to, or is a symptom of SC disability, and where the alcohol or drug abuse disability is not due to willful misconduct, then a Veteran may establish SC for the alcohol or drug abuse disability on a secondary basis.\nThe Federal Circuit, in\nAllen v. Principi\n, 237 F. 3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001), held that\n38 U.S.C. 1110\n, precludes payment of compensation in only two situations\nprimary alcohol abuse disabilities that arise during service, or\nsecondary disabilities (such as cirrhosis of the liver) that result from primary alcohol abuse.\nThe Federal Circuit defined “primary” as meaning an alcohol abuse disability arising during service from voluntary and willful drinking to excess.  In addition, substance abuse may be a symptom of worsening of an SC condition resulting in a higher rating for that condition.\nImportant\n:  Do\nnot\nsever SC that was properly established under regulations  in effect prior to November 1, 1990, or\naward an increase in compensation for the secondary effects of alcohol based on any claim received after October 31, 1990, including a claim\nfor an increased evaluation, or\nto add a dependent.\nNote\n:  Cost-of-living increases, for which no claim is required, may be paid.\nReference\n:  For more information on line of duty and alcohol abuse, see\n38 CFR 3.301(d)\n, and\nAllen v. Principi\n, 237 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001).",
