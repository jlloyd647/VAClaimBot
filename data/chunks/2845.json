McDonough\n, 34 Vet.App. 84 (2021).\nExample 1\n:  VA may, in developing a Veteran’s claim for SC for sinusitis, provide the Veteran with an examination that renders a diagnosis of a similar condition, such as allergic rhinitis, rather than sinusitis.\nResult\n:  In the event that the examination is otherwise sufficient for rating purposes and the condition is associated with service, the decision maker awards SC for allergic rhinitis as within the scope of the claim for sinusitis.\nExample 2\n:  The Veteran’s VA examination shows that their SC posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) warrants an increase to a 70-percent evaluation.  In addition, the Veteran reported being fired from several jobs due to their inability to deal with stress, and the VA examiner identified the Veteran’s stress management problem as a symptom of PTSD.\nResult\n:  The decision maker addresses the issue of individual unemployability (IU) in the rating decision.\nExample 3\n:  The Veteran submits a claim for SC for right knee strain.  The evidence of record, including the resulting examination, shows that SC for the knee strain is warranted.  The examination also reveals a knee scar that resulted from a post-service arthroscopy procedure.  The examination indicates the arthroscopy was associated with the SC right knee strain.  The examination also shows that the scar is not painful or unstable and is less than 6 square inches.\nResult\n:  In the event that the examination is otherwise sufficient for rating purposes, the decision maker awards SC for the knee condition and separate SC for the noncompensable knee scar as within the scope of the claim for SC for right knee strain.\nExample 4\n:  The Veteran submits a claim for SC for hearing loss, earaches, and sinusitis.  Later, the Veteran submits a lay statement reporting that everyday sounds cause discomfort.  Private medical records show a diagnosis of hyperacusis.  Hyperacusis was also diagnosed during the VA audiology examination.\nResult\n:  In view of the evidence, the express claim for hearing loss and earaches must be sympathetically read as encompassing the diagnosed disability hyperacusis.  Decreased sound tolerance (hyperacusis) reasonably falls within the claim for an audiological condition manifested by hearing deficits and ear pain.  If the examination is otherwise sufficient for rating purposes, make a decision on SC for hyperacusis.  Otherwise defer for a new and/or adequate examination or other required development.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nsympathetic reading of a claim, see\nRobinson v.
