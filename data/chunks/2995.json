Brown\n, 6 Vet.App. 259 (1994), liberally interpreted VA’s rule against pyramiding in a manner favorable to the claimant, VA determined that no regulatory changes were required as a result of that decision.\nOn June 10, 1994, a Veteran submitted a claim for an increased evaluation for residuals of an SC facial injury.  The claim was received after the date of the\nEsteban\ndecision.\nAnalysis\n:  Based solely on CAVC’s decision, the evaluation of the facial injury was increased effective June 10, 1994, the date of receipt of claim.\nThe provisions of\n38 CFR 3.114(a)\ndo not apply.  No retroactive award is warranted because CAVC decisions are not liberalizing issues for purposes of a retroactive effective date.",
