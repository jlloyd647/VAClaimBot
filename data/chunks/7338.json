Shinseki\n, 26 Vet.App. 18 (2012), CAVC indicated that the plain language of\n38 CFR 3.156(c)(2)\n, when compared to the plain language of pre-amendment\n38 CFR 3.156(c)\n, created a bar to reconsideration based on newly associated service department records in particular circumstances where absolutely no bar previously existed.  Thus, CAVC held that the addition of subsection (c)(2) was a substantive rule change.  In claims filed prior to or pending at the time of the October 2006 addition of\n38 CFR 3.156(c)(2)\n, the version of\n38 CFR 3.156(c)\nin effect prior to the regulatory revision should be applied.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nthe applicability of substantive changes to\n38 CFR 3.156(c)(2)\nin October 2006, see\nCline v. Shinseki\n, 26 Vet.App. 18 (2012), and\nthe regulation in effect prior to October 6, 2006, see\nhistorical 38 CFR 3.156(c)\n.",
