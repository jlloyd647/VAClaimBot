Richmond\n, 496 U.S. 414 (1990) that\npayments of money from the Federal Treasury are limited to those authorized by statute, and erroneous advice given by a Government employee to a benefit claimant cannot stop the Government from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law.\nNote\n:  Since the rating decision is\nnot\nin question, the\nauthority to sever SC is absent\nerror was not in the decision, but in the communication of that decision, and\nclaimant never met the statutory requirements for the benefit.",
