unmistakable error (CUE) in a rating decision that, when corrected, will\nnot\nbenefit the beneficiary.\nImportant\n:\nAlways follow the instructions in the table below when correction of a CUE involves the severance of service connection (SC), even if severing SC will not affect the current or a prior combined disability evaluation.\nExceptions\n:  Disregard the instructions in the table below and follow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.B\n, if SC is severed because the granting of SC was clearly illegal, or\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.C.1.b\n, if correction of an erroneously assigned effective date or disability evaluation does not result in a reduction in the current or a prior combined disability evaluation.\nExample\n:  Follow the instructions in the table below if\nthe rating activity erroneously assigned an effective date of May 23, 2015, for a grant of SC for a disability the rating activity evaluated as 30-percent disabling\nthe Veteran has\nno\nother service-connected (SC) disabilities, and\nthe proper effective date is October 19, 2015.\nStep\nAction\n1\nEstablish end product (EP) 930.\nException\n:  Do not establish EP 930 if a rating EP, such as EP 020, is already pending.\n2\nPrepare a rating decision that\nproposes correction of the error, and\ncites all the material facts and justification for the proposed action.\nImportant\n:  If correction of the error could result in the assignment of a reduced evaluation for an SC disability, include in the rating decision the proposed\nevaluation of the disability in question, and\ncombined evaluation, if applicable.\nReference\n:  For more information on rating decisions that propose a reduction in a disability evaluation, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 3.D\n.\n3\nObtain approval of the proposed rating action from one of the officials identified in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.A.3.e\n.\nImportant\n:  Do\nnot\ninform the beneficiary or beneficiary’s power of attorney of the proposed rating action before obtaining the approval referenced in this step.\n4\nWas an EP 930 established in Step 1?\nIf\nyes\n,\nclear the EP 930, and\nestablish EP 600.\nIf\nno\n,\npromulgate the rating decision under the pending rating EP, and\nestablish EP 600.\nNote\n:  Promulgation of a rating decision prepared under EP 930 might be necessary under the following rare circumstance:\nthe EP 930 was established based on the discovery of\nmultiple\nCUEs, and\ncorrection of one or more of the CUEs would not constitute an adverse action.\n5\nDoes the CUE consist\nonly\nof the assignment of an incorrect effective date?\nIf\nyes\n, go to Step 16.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n6\nPrepare a notice of proposed adverse action that meets the requirements set forth in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 3.A.2\n.\nImportant\n:\nNotify the beneficiary that the effective date of the proposed action will be the first day of the month following a 60-day period that begins the date of the notice of the final rating decision.\nIf the beneficiary is a Veteran, invite them to submit\nVA Form 21P-527EZ, Application for Veterans Pension\n, if\nbasic eligibility for pension exists, and\nit appears pension might be the greater or only benefit to which the Veteran might be entitled.\nReference\n:  For more information on establishing entitlement to pension, see\nM21-1, Part IX, Subpart i, 2\n.\n7\nDid the beneficiary respond to the notice of proposed adverse action within 65 days?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 13.\n8\nDid the beneficiary request a hearing within 30 days of the date of the notice of proposed adverse action?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step\nafter\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\nholds the hearing, and\nobtains any relevant evidence the beneficiary identified during the hearing (or determines the evidence is unavailable).\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n9\nDid the beneficiary provide evidence showing\nno\nCUE exists?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 13.\n10\nPrepare a rating decision that confirms and continues the prior rating decision.\nObtain approval of the rating decision from one of the officials identified in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.A.3.e\n.\nException\n:  Approval by one of the officials identified in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.A.3.e\n, is\nnot\nrequired if\na Decision Review Officer decides no CUE exists, and\nthe decision involves an issue on a legacy appeal.\n11\nPromulgate the rating decision.\n12\nNotify the beneficiary that VA will\nnot\ntake the action it proposed.\nDisregard the remaining steps in this table.\n13\nPrepare a rating decision that corrects the error.\nUpdate the\nCodesheet\nso that it reads how it should have read had no error been made.\nImportant\n:  If the beneficiary submitted any kind of evidence in response to the notice of proposed adverse action referenced in Step 6, obtain approval of the rating decision from one of the officials identified in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.A.3.e\n,\nbefore\ngoing to the next step.\nException\n:  When the CUE involves severance of SC that results in the discontinuation of all compensation (no SC disabilities or only noncompensable SC disabilities remain), do not update the\nCodesheet\nso that it reads how it should have read had no error been made.  Instead, follow the interim procedures provided in the document titled\nSOP for CUE Severance Award Processing\n.\n14\nWill promulgation of the rating decision result in an overpayment of benefits that equals or exceeds $25,000?\nIf\nyes\n,\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart i, 2.B.3.g and h\n, replacing the term “administrative decision” with “rating decision,” and\ngo to the next step following receipt of approval from Compensation Service or Pension and Fiduciary (P&F) Service.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n15\nEstablish EP 960, using the date VA discovered the error as the date of claim\npromulgate the EP 600 rating decision, adjusting the award to ensure\nno overpayment is created, and\nthe beneficiary will continue to receive their current rate of payment until the first day of the month following a 60-day period that begins the date of the notice of the final rating decision, and\ngo to Step 23.\nExample\n:  If the date of the notice of the final rating decision is April 22, then\n60 days following that date is June 21, and\nthe first day of the following month is July 1.\nReference\n:  For more information on EP 960 usage in relation to the adverse action proposal period, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 3.B.4.b\n.\n16\nPrepare a notice of proposed adverse action that meets the requirements set forth in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 3.A.2\n.\n17\nDid the beneficiary respond to the notice of proposed adverse action within 65 days?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 20.\n18\nDid the beneficiary request a hearing within 30 days of the date of the notice of proposed adverse action?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step\nafter\nVA\nholds the hearing, and\nobtains any relevant evidence the beneficiary identified during the hearing (or determines the evidence is unavailable).\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n19\nDid the beneficiary provide evidence showing\nno\nCUE exists?\nIf\nyes\n, return to Step 10.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n20\nPrepare a rating decision that corrects the error.\nUpdate the\nCodesheet\nso that it reads how it should have read had no error been made.\nImportant\n:  If the beneficiary submitted any kind of evidence in response to the notice of proposed adverse action referenced in Step 16, obtain approval of the rating decision from one of the officials identified in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.A.3.e\n,\nbefore\ngoing to the next step.\nException\n:  When the CUE involves severance of SC that results in the discontinuation of all compensation (no SC disabilities or only noncompensable SC disabilities remain), do not update the\nCodesheet\nso that it reads how it should have read had no error been made.  Instead, follow the interim procedures provided in the document titled\nSOP for CUE Severance Award Processing\n.\n21\nWill promulgation of the rating decision result in an overpayment of benefits that equals or exceeds $25,000?\nIf\nyes\n,\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart i, 2.B.3.g and h\n, replacing the term “administrative decision” with “rating decision,” and\ngo to the next step following receipt of approval from
