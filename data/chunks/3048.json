Shinseki\n, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011), the painful extension could only be considered limited for the purpose of determining whether a 10-percent evaluation can be assigned for the joint under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5003\n, which is not applicable in this example because a compensable evaluation was already assigned for flexion under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5260\n.\n38 CFR 4.59\ndoes not support a separate compensable evaluation for painful extension.  The regulation states that the intention of the rating schedule is to recognize actually painful joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable evaluation for the joint, not for each painful movement.\nIf the fact pattern involved chondromalacia patella or a knee strain rather than tenosynovitis, the result would be the same.",
