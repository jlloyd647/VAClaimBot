Nicholson\n, 20 Vet.App. 296 (2006), CAVC held that VA has no authority to adjudicate a “freestanding” request for an earlier effective date associated with an RO decision that has become finally adjudicated under\n38 CFR 3.160(d)\n.\nAlthough VA cannot consider a request for an earlier effective date on a finally adjudicated RO decision, the claimant\nmay\nallege CUE with respect to the assignment of the effective date in that prior decision.  For the CUE claim to be considered valid, the claimant must specify the factual or legal errors at issue.\nExample\n:  A claimant’s statement that “my effective date is wrong, or “I want an earlier effective date” does not sufficiently specify the factual or legal error at issue.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nprocessing freestanding requests for an earlier effective date, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.8.b\nrevising decisions based on CUE, see\n38 CFR 3.105(a)\n, and\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.A\nprescribed forms for a specific benefit, see\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 1.A.1.a\n.",
