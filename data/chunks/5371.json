United States Veterans Administration\n, No\n.\nC86-6160 THE (N.D. Cal.), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\nOn May 3, 1989, the District Court invalidated a portion of the historical 38 CFR 3.311a.  All denials after September 24, 1985, that were based on 38 CFR 3.311a were voided, and a moratorium was placed on further denials.  The moratorium was lifted on February 15, 1994.\nOn September 24, 2003, a new regulation,\n38 CFR 3.816\n, was added to provide guidance in the adjudication of claims under the\nNehmer\nlitigation.\nReference\n:  For more information on the\nNehmer\nstipulation, see the\nNehmer Training Guide\n.",
