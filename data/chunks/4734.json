Shinseki\n, 727 F.3d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2013), VA must use the evidentiary standard of the state in which a common law marriage took place in order to determine the validity of a common law marriage.\nTypically,\nall\nof the elements listed below must be present before a common law marriage may be established.\nElement\nDescription\nAn agreement between the parties to be married\nOften this agreement is explicit, but it can be inferred from the conduct of the parties. The statement of one of the parties that there was no agreement to be married is not necessarily conclusive, especially when\nthe statement is self-serving, and\nthere is evidence that the parties held themselves out as married.\nCohabitation\nThe parties actually lived together for some period of time.\nHolding out to the public as married\nThe parties represented themselves to members of the community as spouses. It is not necessary to have used the same last name.\nReference\n:  For the procedure for developing for evidence of a common law marriage, see\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 2.B.2.b\n.",
