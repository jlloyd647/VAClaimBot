The evidence must establish permanence of the total evaluation, as discussed in\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.4.d\n. Total evaluations assigned under the following provisions are temporary:\nprestabilization (\n38 CFR 4.28\n)\nextended VA hospitalization (\n38 CFR 4.29\n)\nconvalescence (\n38 CFR 4.30\n), and\nany DC that provides for a limited period of total disability for convalescence such as joint replacements or cardiac procedures.\nExceptions\n:\nVeterans who are considered P&T disabled prior to the assignment of a 100-percent evaluation under a DC with a limited duration and future examination will be considered permanently disabled during the total evaluation.  The status of permanency is reconsidered following completion of the examination.\nExample\n:  A Veteran who is considered permanently and totally disabled because of a heart disorder based on metabolic equivalents (METs) undergoes cardiac transplantation surgery.  The Veteran would continue to be considered P&T disabled for the duration of the one-year convalescent period under\n38 CFR 4.104, DC 7019\n.\nA temporary total evaluation on the date of death will establish a P&T disability.  Total disability did persist from the date assigned until the end of the person’s life.",
