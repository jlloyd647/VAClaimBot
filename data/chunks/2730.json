Nicholson\n, 20 Vet.App. 79 (2006), that medical evidence that suggests a nexus but is too equivocal or lacking in specificity to support a decision on the merits still triggers the duty to assist under\n38 U.S.C. 5103A(d)\nregarding medical examinations/opinions if it indicates that the Veteran’s condition “may be associated” with service.\nCAVC, in\nTrafter v. Shinseki\n, 26 Vet.App. 267 (2013), held that VA is precluded from considering the absence of evidence as substantive negative evidence to decide that VA has complied with duty-to-assist provisions.",
