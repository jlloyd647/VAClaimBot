For this reason, supervisors must use the specific subject line identified in this block.\nNotes\n:\nVBMS OIT may contact the supervisor if additional information is needed before processing the request.\nEach\nVBMS Request for Document Deletion Form\nshould be saved electronically in a central location at each RO, for use as\nreference material when answering questions from VBMS OIT, and\na record of how the document deletion decision was made.\nReference\n:  For more information on editing a document’s subject line, see the\nVBMS Core User Guide\n.",
