Apply the principles below when evaluating the absence of evidence in the record.\nAbsence of an entry in a record may be evidence against the existence of a fact if such a fact would ordinarily be recorded.\nA claimant’s lay statement may be weighed against the absence of contemporary medical evidence.\nImportant\n:  Do not use the absence of evidence as negative evidence in cases where the claimant has simply failed to prove an element of the claim by the applicable standard (typically relative equipoise).  However, the absence of any positive evidence, such as medical evidence showing diagnosis or treatment, may be considered in determining whether the benefit may be awarded.\nReference\n:  For more information on considering the absence of evidence, see\nBuczynski v. Shinseki\n, 24 Vet.App. 221 (2011)\nHorn v. Shineki\n, 25 Vet.App. 231 (2012)\nAZ and AY v. Shinseki\n, 731F.3d 1303 (2013), and\nFountain v. McDonald\n, 27 Vet.App. 258 (Fed. Cir. 2015).",
