Peake\n, 22 Vet.App. 280 (2008), VA may potentially consider an IU claim for a particular SC disability even when a schedular 100-percent rating is already in effect for another SC disability in order to determine the Veteran’s eligibility for housebound benefits under\n38 U.S.C. 1114(s)\n.\nNote\n:  The effective date for an IU rating in this case may overlap a period where a 100-percent schedular rating was already established, so long as all other requirements for that separate rating and effective date were met.\nOther factors to consider in assigning the IU effective date are\nthe earliest date the evidence shows IU, if a claim is received within one year from such date, or\nthe date of claim, provided that the evidence shows entitlement as of that date and it is not prior to August 1, 1975.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\neffective dates, see\n38 CFR 3.400(o)\n, and\nhousebound entitlement based on schedular ratings less than 100 percent, see\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A.10.b\n.",
