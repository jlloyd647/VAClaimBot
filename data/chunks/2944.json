United States Veterans Administration\n, No. CV86-6160 TEH (N.D. Cal.), have not been met.  The evidence also supports a grant of SC as secondary to the Veteran’s SC diabetes mellitus.  For the secondary theory of entitlement, the effective date would be the date of receipt of the claim.  As the presumptive theory allows for assignment of an earlier effective date, SC should be granted on the presumptive basis to allow for maximized benefits.",
