Brown\n, 9 Vet.App. 73 (1996).  If there is any doubt after consideration of all evidence of record, the rating activity will continue the rating in effect in accordance with\n38 CFR 3.344(b)\n, and will determine whether 18, 24, or 30 months will be allowed to elapse before reexamination will be made.\nImportant\n:  When reviewing a disability evaluation in light of a liberalizing change in the rating schedule, it is not necessary to consider\n38 CFR 3.344\nif the disability percentage in place prior to the change is continued under the liberalized criteria per\nVAOPGCPREC 9-1992\n.",
