Shinseki\n, 700 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012) and\nCaffrey v. Brown\n, 6 Vet.App.377, 384 (1994).\nException\n:  A failure to consider VA medical records, which were in VA’s constructive possession at the time of the prior decision, may constitute a CUE, if such failure affected the outcome of the claim.  See\nVAOPGCPREC 12-1995\n.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nduty to assist in obtaining VA medical center records, see\nM21-1, Part III, Subpart i, 2.C.1\n, and\nM21-1, Part III, Subpart ii, 1.A.2\npotential errors in following procedures, see\nAllin v.
