Knox for archiving if a service member\nretires from active duty\nis released from active duty with\nno\nfurther service obligation, or\nis released from active duty with a service obligation but is not actively serving in a specific Reserve or National Guard unit.\nNotes\n:\nThe military field activity is responsible for ensuring that all personnel records are added to the OMPF in iPERMS during the separation/retirement process.\nWith the exception of enlistment examination and Physical Evaluation Board reports, the OMPF rarely contains any STRs.\nPrior to August 2005, the Army referred to the OMPF of an enlisted service member as the “military personnel records jacket” (MPRJ).\nThe Army began digitizing the OMPF into iPERMS on October 1, 1994 and continued to transfer the original, paper versions of OMPFs to NPRC for storage until July 1, 2002.",
