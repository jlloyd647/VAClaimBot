Service or Pension and Fiduciary Service?\nIf\nyes\n,\nreroute the mail to the appropriate business line, following the guidance in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart i, 2.D.7\n, and\ntake no further action.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n2\nIs the mail related to a\npending\nclaim, higher-level review, or legacy appeal, or does it represent late-flowing mail that was submitted in response to development of a recently adjudicated claim or legacy appeal?\nIf\nyes\n,\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart i, 2.A.5.d\n, and\ndisregard the remaining steps in this table.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\nNote\n:  To answer the question posed in this step, check all applicable claims-processing systems, including\nVBMS\nVACOLS, and\nCaseflow.\n3\nDoes the mail involve a claim that falls under the jurisdiction of a restricted access claims center (RACC) because the claimant is a Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) employee-Veteran, a relative of an employee, an employee or relative of a Veterans service organization, or other restricted record-designee as defined in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart ii, 2.B\n?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 6.\n4\nDoes the mail represent a claim or legacy appeal that is subject to National Work Queue (NWQ) routing?\nIf\nyes\n,\nactivate the\nRestricted Access\ncorporate flash\nensure access to the corresponding VA record is restricted by assigning one of the sensitivity levels described in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart ii, 2.B\n, and\ngo to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\nImportant\n:  ROs must request assistance from their NWQ point of contact when transferring a claim if they are unable to activate the\nRestricted Access\ncorporate flash because VA has already assigned one of the sensitivity levels described in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart ii, 2.B\n.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nmanaging flashes, see the\nVBMS Core User Guide\nappropriate restricted record and sensitive access designations, see the\nSensitive Record Designations and Authorizations OBI Letter\n, and\nrestricted access claim attributes, see\nM21-4, Appendix E.1\n.\n5\nTransfer the mail to the appropriate RACC queue (St. Paul RACC, Milwaukee RACC, or San Diego RACC) and take no further action.\nNotes\n:\nSystem access settings prevent most RO employees from updating VA’s systems to reflect the receipt of evidence or information included in mail that a RACC must ultimately process.\nRACC development letters include a coversheet that recipients are instructed to place on top of mail they send to VA.  Use of the coversheet in this manner facilitates automatic routing of the mail to the appropriate RACC queue.\nTo avoid improper routing in the CM portal, Public Contact Team personnel accepting mail from VBA employee-Veterans must use the appropriate coversheet from the\nRACC Cover Sheets\nsite.\nReference\n:  For more information on RACC jurisdiction, see\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart ii, 2.B\n.\n6\nDoes the mail represent material that a PMC must review/process?\nIf\nyes\n,\nuse the map below to determine the PMC with jurisdiction\ntransfer the mail to the appropriate PMC queue, and\ntake no further action.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n7\nDoes the mail represent a\nnew\ncompensation\n-related claim, or does it include a\nVA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)\n, or\nVA Form 9\n, Appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals\n?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 12.\n8\nWill the RO that received the mail retain jurisdiction?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 11.\nImportant\n:\nROs may\nnot\ntransfer claims (rating or non-rating), legacy appeals, or work items, to include mail received in the CM portal, to another RO solely because the claimant resides within another RO’s geographical jurisdiction.  ROs may transfer a claim to another RO only if the\nclaimant has requested a personal hearing\nclaimant is a homeless Veteran, or\nclaim is a “special mission claim” that a specific RO must process.\n9\nDoes the mail represent a claim?\nIf\nyes\n,\nplace the claim under control according to the instructions in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 3.A.1\n, and\ngo to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n10\nUpload the mail into the appropriate eFolder and disregard the remaining steps in this table.\n11\nFollow the instructions in the table below.\nIf the claim, legacy notice of disagreement (NOD), or\nVA Form 9\n…\nThen…\nrequires a formal legacy appeal or pre-decisional hearing, or\npertains to a homeless Veteran\nestablish the EP in the appropriate claims-processing or appeals-management system\nbroker the EP to the RO with geographic jurisdiction based on the claimant’s or appellant’s place of residence, and\ntake no further action.\ninvolves special mission issues with exclusive jurisdiction, or\ninvolves\nexceptions to general policy for claims folder jurisdiction\ndetermine jurisdiction by following the guidance found in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart ii, 3\ntransfer the mail to the proper RO’s queue, and\ntake no further action.\n12\nDoes the mail represent a fiduciary matter?\nIf\nyes\n, refer the incoming fiduciary-related mail, correspondence, or documents via the CM portal to the fiduciary hub (hub) of jurisdiction unless the PMC or VSC is authorized to take action on the mail as provided in\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 6.E.1.d\n.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\nImportant\n:\nDo not update the contact or direct deposit information when the beneficiary has a fiduciary or change the beneficiary’s name when a beneficiary is assigned a spouse fiduciary.\nFollow the guidance in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 3.B.1.c\n, to notify the hub of jurisdiction when a\nvalid change of contact or direct deposit information is received for a beneficiary that has a fiduciary, or\nbeneficiary is assigned a spouse fiduciary and a request to change the beneficiary’s name is received.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nbasic user mail-processing roles in the CM portal, see\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart i, 2.A.5.b\nhub jurisdiction and contact information, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 6.C.1.d\nhandling a name change for a beneficiary, custodian, or fiduciary, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 6.E.1.d\n, and\nbeneficiary is assigned a spouse fiduciary and a request to change the beneficiary’s name is received, see\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 3.B.1.c\n.\n13\nDoes a review of the mail reveal that no action is needed?\nIf\nyes\n,\ntreat the mail as “file mail” or “drop mail,” and\nupload the mail into the appropriate eFolder\n.\nIf\nno\n,\ntake all necessary actions (such as processing an intent to file (ITF) a claim, changing an address, updating the POA, and so on), and\nupload the mail into the appropriate eFolder.\nNote\n:  Effective March 24, 2015, new claims/legacy appeals must be filed on a fully completed, prescribed VA form.\nReference\n:  For more information about ITF and\nVA Form 21-0966\n,\nIntent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC\n, see\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 2.A\n.",
