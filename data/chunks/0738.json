The forms without an electronic signature from this period remain valid for VA purposes.\nIn rare circumstances, the\nVA Form 21-22\nmay not correctly upload to the eFolder.  Claims processors may presume that a POA was legitimately established using the VDC/SEP process if a review of the POA history on the ALL RELATIONSHIPS tab (accessible via the CORPORATE INQUIRY command) in Share shows that the POA appointment update was performed by\nVAEBENEFITS\n.\nClaims processors must contact the\nEnterprise Veterans Self Service (EVSS) Helpdesk\nif the\nVA Form 21-22\nis not of record and more than 48 hours have passed since the appointment of the POA via VDC/SEP.  In this specific situation, do not follow the failure-to-upload procedure described in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart ii, 2.A\n.\nReference\n:  For more information on\nthe Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), see the\nVBMS Core User Guide\n, and\nShare, see the\nShare User Guide\n.",
