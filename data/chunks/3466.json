Conversely, the DLCO result for asbestosis is not considered in the next higher criteria for\n38 CFR 4.97, DC 6602\n(Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV-1) of 40 to 55 percent predicted; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent; at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations; or, intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids).  Therefore, elevation is not appropriate.",
