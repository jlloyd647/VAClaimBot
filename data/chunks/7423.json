Shinseki\n, 24 Vet.App. 139, 141 (2010).\nExample\n:  The Veteran claims original service connection (SC) for prostate cancer on May 5, 2010.  He submits medical evidence revealing he underwent a prostatectomy on February 5, 2010.  Additional VA medical records on August 28, 2010, show the Veteran was free and clear of prostate cancer and that he awakes to void two times per night.  VA grants SC for prostate cancer at 100 percent from May 5, 2010, and 10 percent from September 1, 2010.  A notice, as required by\n38 CFR 3.105(e)\n, was not issued.\nAlthough the diagnostic code (DC) under which the Veteran is rated,\n38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7528\n, indicates any change in evaluation is subject to the provisions of\n38 CFR 3.105(e)\n, the provisions\ndo not\napply in this case since there was not a running award at the time of the rating decision.\nReference\n:  For more information on the inapplicability of\n38 CFR 3.344\nin staged ratings, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 4.A.2.e\n.",
