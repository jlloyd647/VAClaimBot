generated because a Veteran failed to return a\nSeptember 2020 or later version\nof\nVA Form 21-0538\n.\nImportant\n:\nIf the Hines ITC sent the Veteran the version of\nVA Form 21-0538\nthat\npreceded\nthe September 2020 version, follow the instructions in the attachment\nHistorical_M21-1III_iii_5_SecK_9-18-20.docx\n.\nOnly the status of those dependents named on the enclosure that accompanies\nVA Form 21-0538\nis subject to verification.\nStep\nAction\n1\nReview the claims folder and mail portal to determine whether the Veteran submitted the form and VA personnel failed to cancel the corresponding diary.\nImportant\n:\nAs indicated in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.2.b\n, a Veteran may verify the status of dependent(s) by telephone instead of submitting\nVA Form 21-0538\n.  If a\nVA Form 27-0820\nis of record that confirms a Veteran verified the status of dependent(s) by telephone, treat the\nVA Form 27-0820\nas a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\n.\nTreat as a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\na\nVA Form 21-686c\nthat meets the following criteria.\nVA must have received the form\nno earlier\nthan one year before the date of the EP 130.\nThe form must account for all of the dependents named on the enclosure that accompanies\nVA Form 21-0538\n.\nVA Form 21-686c\nmust have been\npersonally signed by the Veteran (or VA-designated fiduciary), or\ncompleted by a VA employee who documents that the information was received from the Veteran (or VA-designated beneficiary).\nNotes\n:\nVA considers as “personally signed” a\nVA Form 21-686c\nthat a Veteran submits to VA electronically through the means described in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 4\nor\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.D\n.\nDo\nnot\ntreat as a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\na\nVA Form 21-686c\ncompleted on a Veteran’s behalf under the provisions of\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.A.4.j\nby anyone other than a VA employee, or\nwhen it is not clearly documented that the VA employee spoke directly with the Veteran to gather information for completion of\nVA Form 21-686c\n.\n2\nIs the\nVA Form 21-0538\nof record?\nIf\nyes\n,\ncancel the corresponding EP, and\ngo to the next step.\nIf\nno\n,\ngo to Step 4.\n3\nWas the form already processed?\nIf\nyes\n,\nensure any necessary award adjustments were made\ncreate a permanent, Veteran-level note that indicates no adjustments were required based on the previously submitted\nVA Form 21-0538\nclear EP 330, and\ntake no further action.\nIf\nno\n,\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.2.c\n, and\ndisregard the remaining steps in this table.\nNote\n:  If the form was already processed and EP 692 and/or 130 are pending, these EPs should be cancelled.  When the EP 692 or 130 were automatically cleared, the RO may still clear EP 330 after reviewing the case and adding the annotation above.  If the EP  692 or 130 were manually cleared by an RO or the dependency contractor (RO 372), then no EP credit is warranted.\n4\nConfirm EP 130,\nDependency Verification - 0538\nis established.\nAdd the\nPotential Under/Overpayment\nspecial issue.\n5\nAttempt to contact the Veteran by telephone.\n6\nWas telephone contact made with the Veteran?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 9.\nImportant\n:  Document\nunsuccessful\nattempts to contact the Veteran by telephone as a permanent note in VBMS.\nReference\n:  For more information on adding notes in VBMS, see the\nVBMS Core User Guide\n.\n7\nAsk the Veteran to provide the same information\nVA Form 21-0538\nrequires them to provide.\n8\nFollow the instructions in the table below.\nIf the Veteran …\nThen …\nprovided the same information\nVA Form 21-0538\nrequires them to provide, and\nreported\nno\nchange in the status of dependent(s)\nrecord the information on\nVA Form 27-0820\ntreat the\nVA Form 27-0820\nas a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\ninform the Veteran (while on the telephone with them) that benefits will continue at the current rate\nclear the EP 130, and\ndisregard the remaining steps in this table.\nprovided the same information\nVA Form 21-0538\nrequires them to provide, and\nreported changes in the status of dependent(s)\nrecord the information on\nVA Form 27-0820\ntreat the\nVA Form 27-0820\nas a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\n, and\ngo to Step 22.\ndid\nnot\nprovide the same information\nVA Form 21-0538\nrequires them to provide\ndocument the conversation with the Veteran on\nVA Form 27-0820\n, and\ngo to the next step.\nImportant\n:\nIf a Veteran provides the same information\nVA Form 21-0538\nrequires\nexcept\nfor\nthe date of an event that necessitates removal of a dependent(s) from the Veteran’s award,\ndisregard the remaining steps in this table, and\nfollow the instructions in the table in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.3.d\n.\nIf the Veteran is unable to provide (by telephone) all of the information\nVA Form 21-0538\nrequires, allow the Veteran until the end of the next business day to provide the missing information (by telephone).  If the Veteran provides the missing information by the end of the next business day, go to Step 22.  Otherwise, go to the next step.\n9\nClear the pending EP 130.\n10\nEstablish EP 600 with a suspense date that is 65 days from the date of the notice of proposed adverse action discussed in the next step.\nAdd the\nPotential Under/Overpayment\nspecial issue.\n11\nPrepare and send to the Veteran a notice of proposed adverse action that\ninforms the Veteran VA plans to reduce benefits effective the first of the month following the date the Veteran last verified the status of the dependent(s) in question due to failure to return a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\n,\nand\nadvises the Veteran the proposed reduction could result in the creation of an overpayment that VA may require the Veteran to repay.\nNotes\n:\nIf a Veteran failed to verify the status of a spouse, propose to remove from the Veteran’s award the spouse and any\nstepchildren\nof whom the spouse is the biological or adoptive parent.  Take this action even if the stepchildren were not on the Veteran’s award as of the date VA sent\nVA Form 21-0538\nto the Veteran for completion.\nIt is unnecessary, in this step, for claims processors to determine the\nactual\ndate the Veteran last verified the status of dependent(s) and the rate to which VA will reduce the Veteran’s award if it takes the proposed action.  To save time, claims processors may wait until they take the action described in Step 19 of this table to make these determinations.  (Claims processors may simply state in the notice of proposed adverse action\nVA proposes to reduce your benefits effective the first of the month following the date you last verified the status of your dependent(s)\nwithout providing the actual date and proposed rate).\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nthe elements of a notice of proposed adverse action, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 3.A.2\n, and\nstepchildren, see\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 3.B.6\n.\n12\nDid VA receive the form within the additional 65-day period?\nIf\nyes\n,\ncancel the EP 330 referenced in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.2.a\nor\nb\n, if pending, and\ngo to Step 22.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\nExceptions\n:  The table below describes exceptions to the instructions in this step.\nIf VA …\nThen …\ndid\nnot\nreceive the form, and\nhas already removed from the Veteran's award all of the dependents or the only dependent whose status the Veteran must verify (because, for example, the dependent child(ren) turned 18 or stopped attending school shortly after VA issued the form)\ngo to Step 19.\nreceived the form, but the Veteran did not sign it or the form is otherwise incomplete\ncancel the EP 330 referenced in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.2.a\n, if pending\ndisregard the remaining steps in this table, and\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.4.c\n.\nException\n:  If the form is complete\nexcept for\nthe date of the event (such as death, divorce or adoption) that necessitates removal of a dependent(s) from the Veteran’s award,\ndisregard the remaining steps in this table, and\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.4.d\n.\nImportant\n:  Treat as a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\na\nVA Form 21-686c\nthat a Veteran\npersonally\nsigns and returns to VA in response to the notice of proposed adverse action referenced in Step 11.\n13\nRemove from the Veteran’s award the dependent(s) whose status the Veteran failed to verify.\nImportant\n:  Remove the dependent(s) from the Veteran’s award effective the date in the LAST PAID DATE field on the AWARD INFORMATION tab in Share.\n14\nBriefly explain the basis for the reduction in the OTHER PRINT REMARKS field on the PRINT REMARKS screen.\n15\nPrepare and send to the Veteran a decision notice that informs them of the following:\nVA has removed from the award the dependent(s) whose status the Veteran failed to verify, effective the date in the LAST PAID DATE field on the AWARD INFORMATION tab in Share, and\nVA will remove from the award the same dependent(s) from an earlier effective date (the first of the month following the date the Veteran last verified the status of the dependent(s), as proposed in the notice of proposed adverse action referenced in Step 11) if the Veteran does not provide verification within 90 days.\n16\nEstablish a diary under diary code 30,\nLocal Regional Office Special Use\n, that expires the month after a 90-day period that begins on the current date.\nReferences\n:  For more information on establishing diaries in\nShare, see the\nShare User Guide\n, and\nVBMS, see the\nVBMS Awards User Guide\n.\n17\nGo to the next step when the\nearlier\nof the following occurs:\nthe Veteran verifies the status of the dependent(s), or\nthe diary established in Step 16 expires.\nNote\n:  Expiration of the diary established in Step 16 triggers the generation of an 810 work item labeled\n631 Diary Due Date/Reason/Legend\n.\n18\nFollow the instructions in the table below.\nIf the Veteran …\nThen …\nreturned\nVA Form 21-0538\nor verified the status of the dependent(s) through other acceptable means\ncancel the EP 330 referenced in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.2.a\nor\nb\n, if pending\nclear the diary established in Step 16 (if it has not yet expired)\nestablish EP 130, using the date VA received verification as the date of claim, and\ngo to Step 22.\nhas not yet verified the status of the dependents\nestablish EP 130, using the date of the 810 work item referenced in Step 17 as the date of claim\nadd the\nPotential Under/Overpayment\nspecial issue, and\ngo to the next step.\n19\nRemove the dependent(s) whose status the Veteran failed to verify effective the first of the month following the date the Veteran last verified the status of the dependent(s) in question.\nNotes\n:\nROs must be prudent in their management of pending diaries.  If an RO were to clear the diary established in Step 16 for a reason other than that specified in Step 18, removal of the Veteran’s dependents from the proper effective date might never occur.\nTo determine the date a Veteran last verified the status of a dependent(s), search the claims folder for the most recent communication with the Veteran that provides such verification.\nExamples\n:  The date a Veteran last verified the status of a dependent(s) could be\nthe date VA last received a\nVA Form 21-686c\nor other form listed in\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 1.A.1.a\n, that shows the status of the dependent(s), or\nthe date of the last documented telephone conversation with the Veteran regarding the status of the dependent(s).\n20\nBriefly explain the basis for the reduction in the OTHER PRINT REMARKS field on the PRINT REMARKS screen.\n21\nNotify the Veteran of the action taken in Step 19.\nDisregard the remaining step in this table.\n22\nFollow the instructions in the table below.\nIf the Veteran reports …\nAnd …\nThen …\nno change in the status of dependent(s)\nVA has\nnot\nreduced the Veteran’s benefits due to failure to return\nVA Form 21-0538\nnotify the Veteran that benefits will continue at the current rate, and\nclear any associated EP(s) that remains pending.\nVA has reduced the Veteran’s benefits due to failure to return\nVA Form 21-0538\nrestore the payment of additional compensation for the dependent(s) the Veteran verified, effective the date VA previously reduced benefits because the Veteran failed to return the form, and\nnotify the Veteran of the action taken.\na change in the status of a dependent(s) that necessitates removal of the dependent(s) from the Veteran’s award\n---\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.3.b\n.\nNotes\n:\nVA will accept a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\n(or\nVA Form 21-686c\nthat meets the criteria set forth in Step 1 of the table above) from a Veteran whose benefits it reduced because the Veteran failed to return a completed\nVA Form 21-0538\n, regardless of the amount of time that has passed since the award adjustment.  When this occurs,\ncancel the EP 330 referenced in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.B.2.a\nor\nb\nestablish EP 130, and\nfollow the instructions in Step 22 of the table above.\nThere is\nno\nrequirement that\nVA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request – Supplemental Claim\n, accompany the completed\nVA Form 21-0538\nor the\nVA Form 21-686c\nreferenced in the preceding note.\nReference\n:  For more information on notifying a Veteran of a decision VA made and/or an action VA took, see\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart i, 1.B\n.",
