These cases will remain at the DRAS for processing.  However, the DRAS must solicit an application for the new condition on a prescribed form so that the new issue(s) can be considered as part of the claim for VA benefits.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nthe service department’s responsibility when adding new referred conditions, see the\nVTA User Guide\n, Section 3.4, and\nhandling cases that are disenrolled due to additional referred conditions, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart i, 6.K.1.j\n.",
