Wilkie\n, 33 Vet.App. 67 (2020), held that the criteria of\n38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100\n, contemplate more than merely headache symptoms, and that the DC requires VA to\nconsider\nall\nsymptoms experienced as a result of migraine attacks, and\nevaluate those symptoms based on the overall frequency, severity, and economic impact of the migraine attacks.\nExample\n:  A Veteran suffers SC migraine headaches that occur twice weekly and are prostrating in nature.  Symptoms manifested during the migraine headache attacks include frontal headaches, photophobia, nausea, and dizziness.  In evaluating the disability under\n38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100\n, VA must consider all symptoms associated with the migraine headache attacks, and not just the headaches themselves.",
