Brown\n, 6 Vet.App. 259, 261-62 (1994)).\nExample 1\n:  A disability of a tibia with malunion, limitation of dorsiflexion, eversion, inversion, and traumatic arthritis of the ankle would be evaluated under one DC,\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5262\n, in accordance with the effect upon ankle function, with no separate evaluation for the limitation of motion or traumatic arthritis.\nExample 2\n:  A shoulder disability manifest as limitation of motion of the arm is entitled to a single rating under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5201\n, regardless of how many planes of motion are affected.\nExample 3\n:  Instability of the knee (\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5257\n) may be evaluated separately from limited motion of the knee due to arthritis (\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5003\n).\nRefe\nr\nence\n:  For more information on separating individual findings for knee disabilities, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.B.4\nVAOPGCPREC 23-1997\n, and\nVAOPGCPREC 9-1998\n.",
