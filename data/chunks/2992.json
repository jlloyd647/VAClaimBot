Brown\n, 6 Vet.App. 259 (1994), CAVC liberally interpreted VA’s rule against pyramiding in a manner favorable to the claimant.\nOn September 1, 1993, a Veteran submitted a claim for an increased evaluation for an SC facial injury.  The claim was still pending on the date of CAVC’s decision for\nEsteban v. Brown\n.\nAnalysis\n:  An increased evaluation was granted based solely upon the\nEsteban\ndecision for the residuals of the facial injury because the Veteran’s condition met the criteria for the increased evaluation.\nThe effective date in this case is September 1, 1993, the date of claim since the claim was pending on the date of the precedential decision.  The assignment of the effective date is not limited to the date of the CAVC decision since it did not result in a liberalizing regulation.",
