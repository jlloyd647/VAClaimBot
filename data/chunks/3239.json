Because thyroid function is normal, the disabling effects of nontoxic thyroid enlargement are generally either manifest as disfigurement or a result of pressure on adjacent organs (such as trachea, larynx, or esophagus). Evaluate this condition based on one or both of these effects, if present.\nReference\n: For more information on evaluating thyroid enlargement, nontoxic, see\n38 CFR 4.119, DC 7902\n.",
