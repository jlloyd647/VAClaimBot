SC (VE INC)\n5003-5201\nDegenerative arthritis, right shoulder (dominant)\n20% from 12-14-03\n5257-5003\nDegenerative arthritis, right knee\n0% from 12-14-03\n5257-5003\nDegenerative arthritis, left knee\n0% from 12-14-03\nCOMB\n20% from 12-14-03\nRationale\n:  Since the shoulder condition meets compensable requirements under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DCs 5201\n, each knee condition must be evaluated under separate DCs.  Based on Note (1) under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5003\n, ratings of arthritis based on x-ray findings only (without limited or painful motion or incapacitating exacerbations)\ncannot\nbe combined with ratings of arthritis based on LOM.",
