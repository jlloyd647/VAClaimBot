United States\n, 580 F.3d 1234 (Fed. Cir. 2009), there is no bar to full concurrent payment of the SBP and DIC, without offset of either benefit, when a surviving spouse is entitled to DIC by virtue of having remarried after attaining a qualifying age.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\npayment of DIC when remarriage occurs, see\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 2.E\n, and\nfull concurrent payment of SBP and DIC when remarriage occurs, see\n38 U.S.C. 1311(e)\n.",
