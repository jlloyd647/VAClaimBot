Shinseki\n, 590 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2010).\nExample\n:  A Veteran files a claim for service connection (SC) for posttraumatic stress disorder.  He reports that he is in receipt of Social Security Administration (SSA) disability benefits and attaches a copy of an SSA decision that found him to be disabled due to back and leg pain from a 2001 injury.  There is no mention of mental health symptoms or treatment in the SSA decision.\nAnalysis\n:  The Federal Circuit, in\nGolz v. Shinseki\n, 590 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2010), held that if an SSA decision pertains to a completely unrelated medical condition and the Veteran makes no specific allegations that would give rise to a reasonable belief that the medical records may nonetheless pertain to the injury for which the Veteran seeks benefits, relevance is not established.",
