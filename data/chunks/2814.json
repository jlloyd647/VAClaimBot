West\n, 216 F.3d 1058 (Fed.Cir. 2000), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that\n38 U.S.C. 1112(a)\nestablishes a presumption of aggravation for chronic diseases that existed prior to service but first manifested to a degree of disability of 10 percent or more within the presumptive period after service.\nUnder\n38 CFR 3.307\n, this presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary or evidence to establish that such disability is due to an intercurrent disease or injury suffered after separation from service.",
