below following receipt of notice from a Veteran that the\nbiological or adoptive parent of the Veteran’s stepchild has died, or\nVeteran and the biological or adoptive parent of the Veteran’s stepchild have\nseparated from one another, or\nterminated their marriage with one another.\nImportant\n:  It is not uncommon for individuals to separate from one another\nbefore\nthey terminate their marriage.  If a Veteran with a stepchild reports termination of the marriage with the stepchild’s biological or adoptive parent, do not assume the stepchild remained a member of the Veteran’s household until the marriage ended.  Unless the Veteran specifically indicates the child was a member of the Veteran’s household until the marriage ended, proceed as if the Veteran did\nnot\nprovide the date the stepchild ceased being a member of their household.\nStep\nAction\n1\nEstablish EP 130.\nAdd\nPotential Under/Overpayment\nas a special issue.\nException\n:  Do\nnot\nadd the special issue if the benefit the Veteran receives is pension.\n2\nFollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.C.4\nfor removing the spouse from the Veteran’s award.\nException\n:  Do\nnot\nremove the\nspouse\nfrom the Veteran’s award if the\nspouse and Veteran are only separated,\nand\nbenefit to which the Veteran is entitled is disability compensation.\nImportant\n:  Because the focus of this topic is\nstepchildren\n, additional instructions for handling the removal of a stepchild’s\nbiological or adoptive parent\nfrom the Veteran’s award – when the Veteran fails to provide the date of death or separation, or the date the marriage ended – were intentionally omitted.  Such instructions exist in\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart i, 1.C.4.f\n.\n3\nFollow the instructions in
