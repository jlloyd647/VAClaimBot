Shinseki\n, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nsympathetic reading and scope of claims, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A\ndeciding claims for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when another mental disorder is diagnosed, see\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.D.2.k\n, and\nconsidering unclaimed theories of SC, see\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 1.A.2.e\n.",
