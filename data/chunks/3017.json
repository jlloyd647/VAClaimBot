Shinseki\n, 25 Vet.App. 32 (2011), held that pain alone does not constitute a functional loss under VA regulations that evaluate disability based upon ROM loss.  Thus, when assigning a disability evaluation based on loss of ROM, painful motion is not considered the same as limited motion unless the pain actually causes a loss of motion.\nFurthermore\nif pain is associated with movement, the examiner must give an opinion on whether pain could significantly limit functional ability during flare-ups or when the joint is used repeatedly over a period of time, and\nthe opinion must, if feasible, be expressed in terms of the degree of additional ROM loss due to pain on use or during flare-ups.\nImpact on application of\n38 CFR 4.59\n:\nExaminations must address the\nMitchell\ncriteria.\nWhen painful motion on repeated use over time or during a flare-up results in additional loss of ROM, then the condition should be evaluated based on the additional loss of ROM.\nROM must be actually limited.  Do not assign an evaluation for loss of ROM based on the point at which pain accompanies motion unless the pain actually causes reduced ROM on objective assessment.\nThe\nMitchell\nholding is not limited in impact to painful motion.  The holding impacts consideration of functional impairment due to pain and other factors as discussed in\n38 CFR 4.40\n,\n38 CFR 4.45\n, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.A.2.c\n.\nThe\nMitchell\nholding is effective August 23, 2011.\nReference\n:  For more information on assessing examinations for adequacy in conjunction with\nMitchell\nand related holdings on ROM and functional loss, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.A.1.j\nand\nk\n, and\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.B.1.f and g\n.",
