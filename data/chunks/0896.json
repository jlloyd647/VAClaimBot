Shinseki\n, 590 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2010) that not all medical records have a reasonable possibility of helping substantiate a pending claim and that the duty to assist applies only to\nrelevant\nrecords.\nImportant\n:  For purposes of determining relevance, the same principles apply to both private and Federal records.\nThe court further held in\nRaugust v. Shinseki\n, 23 Vet.App. 475 (2010), that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has no duty to obtain records without a specific reason to believe that the records identified by the Veteran would contain necessary information to substantiate the claim.\nExample\n:\nA Veteran files a claim for an increased evaluation for residuals of a service-connected (SC) left ankle fracture.  He reports treatment at the Mayo Clinic for headaches.\nAnalysis\n:  The information available on its face shows that the identified private records would\nnot\nbe relevant as they do not relate to the Veteran’s SC disability nor do they have a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim.",
