Wilkie\n, 906 F. 3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\nReferences\n:  For more information on\ndue process and authorization issues for CUEs that will not benefit the beneficiary, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.C.1.a\n, and\nwhen a proposed rating decision is required, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 3.D.1\n.",
