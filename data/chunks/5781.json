In most cases, participation should be documented in the Chemical Biological Warfare Exposure System Registry in the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER); however, test participation may also be documented in service records.\nExceptions\n:  The following exposure claims are not considered CBRNE claims as they have their own unique policies and procedures:\nShipboard Hazards and Defense (SHAD) Project as defined in\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 6.A.1.a\n, and\nmustard gas and Lewisite exposure as defined in\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 3.A.1.a\n.\nReference\n:  For more information on CBRNE testing, see the\nMilitary Health System Cold War website\n.",
