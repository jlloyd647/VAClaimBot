Shinseki\n, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), does not require that all mental health claims be treated as one\n38 CFR 3.304(f)\nprovides additional means by which SC for PTSD can be established, and\nreceipt of the Afghanistan Campaign Medal would generally satisfy the requirement for a stressor involving service in an area of potential hostile military or terrorist activity.\nExample 2\n:  A Veteran who is currently SC for bronchial asthma, evaluated as 30-percent disabling, files a claim for SC for obstructive sleep apnea requiring the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.\nResult\n:  The RO must decide the sleep apnea claim on its individual merits and not generally assume that the Veteran, in contending a separate respiratory condition, intended to seek an increased evaluation for SC asthma.  Although\n38 CFR 4.96(a)\nwould prohibit the assignment of separate compensable evaluations for both asthma and sleep apnea if SC for the latter were ultimately awarded,\n38 CFR 4.97, diagnostic code (DC) 6847\n, may permit assignment of a greater collective evaluation in light of the required CPAP use.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nclarifying issues and claims, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.1.h\n, and\nconsidering diagnosed conditions as bases for separate and distinct claims, see\nBoggs v. Peake\n, 520 F.3d 1330, (2008), and\nVelez v. Shinseki\n, 23 Vet.App. 199 (2009).",
