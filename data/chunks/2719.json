Derwinski\n, 1 Vet.App. 49 (1990), CAVC noted that an equipoise decision is\nnecessarily more qualitative than quantitative; it is one not capable of mathematical precision and certitude.  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of material contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value\n.\nCAVC further likened the reasonable doubt rule as akin to the principle in baseball that the “tie goes to the runner.”\nReference\n:  For more information on the reasonable doubt rule, see\n38 CFR 3.102\n, and\n38 CFR 4.3\n.",
