West\n, 142 F.3d 1434, 1439 (Fed.Cir.1998), a presumption has evidentiary value, but it is not a form of evidence.  It is a legal mechanism that relieves a party from having to produce evidence sufficient to establish the point at issue.  As noted by the\nRouten\nanalysis, when the predicate evidence is established, the remaining evidentiary gap is filled by the presumption.\nVA presumptions may be rebutted.  This means that when proof to the contrary of the evidentiary matter relieved by the presumption exists in the record, the presumption may be rebutted.  When the presumption is rebutted, the burden shifts back to the claimant seeking the benefit to prove the facts with evidence.\nVA presumptions include the presumptions of\nsoundness\naggravation, and\nservice connection (SC).\nReferences\n:  For more information on the\npresumption of soundness, see\n38 U.S.C. 1111\n,\nand\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.A.2\npresumption of aggravation, see\n38 U.S.C. 1153\n,\nand\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.C.2\n, and\npresumption of SC, see\n38 U.S.C. 1112\n,\nand\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.B\n.",
