Shinseki\n, 722 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2013), held that a Veteran is entitled to a single rating under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5201\n,\neven though a shoulder disability results in LOM in both flexion (raising the arm in front of the body) and abduction (raising the arm away from the side of the body).\nReferences\n:  For more information on\npyramiding of evaluations, see\n38 CFR 4.14\n, and\nEsteban v.
