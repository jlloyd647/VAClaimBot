Payments commence upon discharge and recur on each anniversary date of discharge thereafter.\nNote\n:  In general, the total number of payments equals twice the number of years of active service, provided the Veteran continues to serve in a reserve unit for the duration of the payments.\nReference\n:  For more information on DoD’s responsibility for adjusting VSI, see\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart ii, 2.1.m\n.",
