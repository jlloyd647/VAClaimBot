Such procedures are considered elective surgeries and therefore do not meet the provisions of a disease or injury incurred coincident with service.\nImportant\n:  If reduction mammoplasty is recommended to alleviate physical discomfort, such as back, shoulder, or neck pain, SC should be considered on the basis of aggravation only, and if so established, SMC (k) would be payable if the resultant tissue loss meets the requirements of the statute.\nReferences\n:  For more information about\nprinciples relating to SC, see\n38 CFR 3.303\n, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.A\naggravation of pre-service disability, see\n38 CFR 3.306\n, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.C\n, and\nentitlement to SMC (k), see\n38 CFR 3.350(a)\n, and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A.4\n.",
