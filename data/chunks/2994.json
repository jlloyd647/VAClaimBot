Brown\n, 5 Vet.App. 108 (1993), CAVC invalidated portions of\n38 CFR 3.53(a)\n.  VA subsequently published an amendment to that regulation that implemented CAVC’s holding with an effective date of the regulation retroactive to May 13, 1993, the date of CAVC’s decision.  On June 1, 1994, the surviving spouse, who had a final decision denying benefits in 1985 due to reliance on the now invalidated regulation, filed a claim.\nAnalysis\n:\nBecause VA issued liberalizing regulations to implement the decision, the\nprovisions of\n38 CFR 3.114(a)\nmust be applied, and\nappropriate effective date is June 1, 1993, one year prior to date of claim.",
