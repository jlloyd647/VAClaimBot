Rather, it pays benefits in\nseparate\nawards to each entitled dependent.  Therefore, the entire amount of benefits that remains, after applying the provisions of\nM21-1, Part XIII, Subpart ii, 1.B.2\n, is considered VA income for SSA purposes.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nNaval pension, see\n38 CFR 3.803\n, and\nbenefits VA pays under\nREPS, see\nM21-1, Part XII, Subpart ii, 3.A\n, and\n38 U.S.C. 1312(a)\n, see\nM21-1, Part XII, Subpart ii, 2.A\n.",
