SC (PTE INC)\n5000\nOsteomyelitis, right tibia\n0% from 12-2-93\nNote\n:  For the scenarios discussed in\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.D.2.a\n-\nh\n, when the scenario involves dates, review the scenarios as if the actions are being taken at or near the time of the evidence presented in each scenario.  In other words, for the purposes of reviewing these scenarios only, do not apply protection of evaluation under\n38 CFR 3.951(b)\n.",
