Shinseki\n, 573 F.3d 1282, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2009), a VA examiner’s statement that an opinion cannot be rendered\nprovides neither positive nor negative support for the claim, and\ndoes not trigger the application of reasonable doubt.\nDo not characterize an examiner’s statement of being unable to render an opinion as “non-evidence.”  Refer to such evidence in the decision narrative in such terms as having neither positive nor negative value.\nReference\n:  For more information on discussing the reasonable doubt rule, see\nGilbert v. Derwinski\n, 1 Vet.App. 49 (1990)\nOrtiz v. Principi\n, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001)\nLynch v. McDonough\n, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021), and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.1\n.",
