For example, when new evidence is received following an initial proposal for a failure to report for a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) examination and the new evidence (possibly including a VA examination) shows improvement warranting a reduction, issue a new rating decision proposing the reduction due to improvement and explaining the new reasons for the proposal.  The due process period will restart following provision of notice of proposed adverse action by the authorization activity.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nsending corrected notice of proposed adverse action, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 3.A.3.e\n, and\npreparing the rating decision narrative, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iv, 1.A\n.",
