Muscle rigidity may be present without tremors.  As the muscle rigidity progresses, movement becomes slow (bradykinesia), decreased or diminished (hypokinesia), and difficult to initiate (akinesia).  Other signs and symptoms may include:\nmuscular aches and fatigue\nmask-like expression with open mouth\ndrooling\nstooped posture\ngait characterized by involuntary, short, accelerating steps\ndifficulty in walking\nloss of postural reflexes (tendency to fall forward or backward with respective shift in center of gravity)\nspeech manifestations – specifically low speech volume with stuttering or slurred speech, or uniformity of tone and high pitch, and\ndysphagia.",
