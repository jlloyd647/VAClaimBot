Development reveals that the Veteran deserted Gary.  Therefore, the continuous cohabitation requirement of\n38 CFR 3.53\nis met.  Gary’s income exceeds the MAPR\n.\nBob’s income is within the limit, and Bob’s marriage to the Veteran meets all the requirements of a deemed valid marriage except for the requirement that no other claimant be found entitled as legal surviving spouse.\nAction\n:  Deny both claims.  Advise Bob to submit another claim after calendar year 2021.  Under\n38 CFR 3.660(b)(1)\n, Gary has until January 1, 2022, to submit a claim showing income was within the limit for the income year extending from Apriil 5, 2019, to April 30, 2020.\nReference\n:  For more information on t\nhe continuous cohabitation requirement, see\n38 CFR 3.53\n.",
