Brown\n, 8 Vet.App. 202 (1995).\nImportant\n:\nA repaired meniscal tear (s/p partial meniscectomy) is not directly synonymous with either\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5258\nor\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5259\n.  Therefore, it is most appropriate to rate the disability analogous to whichever code most closely approximates the current symptoms.\nEntitlement to a separate evaluation for the meniscal disability depends on whether the manifestations are utilized to assign an evaluation under a different DC.  Evaluation of the same manifestation under multiple diagnoses is prohibited under\n38 CFR 4.14\n.  Thus, when all the symptoms of the meniscal disability are used to support elevation of an evaluation under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5260/5261\nor assignment of an evaluation under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5257\n, a separate evaluation cannot be assigned under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5258/5259\n.\nWhen considering applicability of\n38 CFR 4.59\nfor meniscal disabilities,\nwhen\nonly\na meniscal disability is present, utilize the procedures at\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.A.1.m\n, and\nwhen multiple knee disabilities are present and the painful motion is attributable to a knee disability other than the meniscal condition, assign separate evaluations when otherwise warranted under\n38 CFR 4.14\n.\nThe policy and procedures identified in this block reflect a change in policy resulting from the holding in\nLyles v. Shulkin\n, 29 Vet.App. 107 (2017), effective November 29, 2017.  Prior to the\nLyles\nholding, separate evaluations for meniscal disabilities under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5258\nor\nDC 5259\nand other knee evaluations under\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5257, 5260, or DC 5261\nwere prohibited.  This is not considered a liberalizing change.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nevaluation of meniscal disabilities, see\nLyles v. Shulkin\n, 29 Vet.App. 107 (2017), and\nexamples of evaluation of meniscal disabilities, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.B.4.f\n.",
