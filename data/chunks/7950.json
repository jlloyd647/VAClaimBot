McDonald\n, 761 F.3d 1366 (2014), a military discharge for alcohol rehabilitation failure, alone, does\nnot\nconstitute willful misconduct.  Based upon a review of the facts and circumstances of the case, there\nmust\nbe an actual finding of willful misconduct that led to alcohol rehabilitation failure.\nReference\n:  For information on requesting facts and circumstances, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart iv, 1.A.1\n.",
