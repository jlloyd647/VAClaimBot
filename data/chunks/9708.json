in the table below to calculate VA income for SSA purposes when the benefit is pension to two Veterans that are married to one another and have at least one child.\nImportant\n:  If SSA lists any of the Veterans’ children as an SSI claimant in Part I of\nSSA Form L1103\n, and VA apportioned benefits to that child during the time period SSA specified in the form, enter the amount of the\napportionment\nin Part II, Section D, of the form rather than the child’s VA income for SSA purposes as calculated in the table below.\nStep\nAction\n1\nDetermine the monthly amount of pension VA actually\npaid out\nto both Veterans, whether in a single award or two separate awards, during the time period SSA specified in Part I of\nSSA Form L1103\n.\nImportant\n:  Do\nnot\ninclude the amount of pension VA apportioned to a child or children during the same time period.\n2\nAdd\nto the amount identified in Step 1 any benefits VA offset, withheld, or deducted each month during the same time period for reasons\nother than\nthose listed in\nM21-1, Part XIII, Subpart ii, 1.B.2.b\n.\n3\nUse the pension\nrate table\nthat covers the time period SSA specified to determine the Veterans’ MAPR during the same time period.\nExample\n:  If a Veteran and their Veteran-spouse are both housebound, and they have two children, their MAPR is $33,608.00, according to the rate table in effect on December 1, 2022.\nImportant\n:  If VA apportioned benefits to a child during this time period, do\nnot\nconsider them a dependent when determining the Veterans’ MAPR.  Using the example above, the Veterans’ MAPR would be $30,865.00 if VA apportioned benefits to one of their children.\n4\nUse the pension\nrate table\nthat covers the time period SSA specified to determine what the MAPR would have been during the same time period for the Veteran and their Veteran-spouse\nonly\n.\nExample\n:  If a Veteran and their Veteran-spouse are both housebound, their MAPR is $21,860.00, according to the rate table in effect from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023.\n5\nDivide the difference between the MAPRs identified in Steps 3 and 4 by the MAPR identified in Step 3.\nNote\n:  Limit the result of the calculation in this step to four decimal positions.  If the number in the\nfifth\ndecimal position is five or greater, round\nup\nthe number in the fourth decimal position.\nExample\n:  Using the examples provided in Steps 3 and 4, the result of the calculation in this step would be .0887.\n6\nMultiply the result of the calculation described in Step 5 by the outcome of the action described in Step 2.  The product represents the share of the Veterans’ pension that is attributed to their child(ren).\nNote\n:  Drop any fractions of a cent from the product.\nExample\n:  If the product is $499.0707, drop the number(s) beyond the second decimal position for a result of $499.07.\n7\nSubtract the result of the calculation described in Step 6 from the outcome of the action described in Step 2.  This represents the amount of pension that is attributed to the Veterans after subtracting the amount of pension that is attributed to their child(ren).\n8\nDid the Veterans have more than one child during the time period SSA specified?\nIf\nyes\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 10.  The result of the calculation described in Step 6 represents the child’s share of the Veterans’ benefits.\nImportant\n:  If VA apportioned benefits to a child during the time period SSA specified, do\nnot\nconsider the child a dependent for the purpose of this step.\n9\nDetermine the amount of benefits attributed to each child by\ndividing the result of the calculation described in Step 6 by the number of the Veterans’ children that were\nnot\nreceiving an apportionment, and\ndropping any fraction of a cent from the remainder.\n10\nDid VA consider either of the Veterans housebound or in need of the A&A of another person during the time period SSA specified?\nIf\nyes\n, go to Step 18.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n11\nDid UMEs have any impact on the Veterans’ rate of payment during the time period SSA specified?\nIf\nyes\n, go to Step 13.\nIf\nno\n, one\nhalf\nof the result of the calculation described in Step 7 represents one Veteran’s VA income for SSA purposes, while the other half represents the other Veteran’s VA income for SSA purposes.  Go to the next step if SSA listed any of the Veteran’s children as an SSI claimant in Part I of\nSSA Form L1103\n.  Otherwise, go no further.\nNote\n:  Drop any fraction of a cent that exists after dividing the result of the calculation described in Step 7 into equal halves.\n12\nGo no further\nafter\nfollowing the instructions in the table below for determining each child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nImportant\n:  If VA apportioned benefits to a child during the time period SSA specified, do\nnot\nconsider the child a dependent for the purpose of this step.\nIf the Veterans had …\nThen ...\nonly one child\nthe result of the calculation described in Step 6 represents the child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nmultiple children\nthe result of the calculation described in Step 9 represents each child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\n13\nDivide by 12 the difference between\nthe Veterans’ IVAP\nbefore\nVA took into account their UMEs, and\nthe Veterans’ IVAP\nafter\nVA took into account their UMEs.\nDrop any fraction of a cent from the result of the calculation.\n14\nIs the result of the calculations described in Step 13 greater than or equal to the result of the calculation described in Step 7?\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\nIf\nyes\n, both Veterans' VA income for SSA purposes is $0.00.  Go to Step 16 if SSA listed any of the Veterans’ children as an SSI claimant in Part I of\nSSA Form L1103\n.  Otherwise, go no further.\n15\nSubtract the result of the calculation described in Step 13 from the result of the calculation described in Step 7.\nDivide the difference into equal halves and drop any fraction of a cent from each half.  One of the halves represents one Veteran’s VA income for SSA purposes, while the other half represents the other Veteran’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nReturn to Step 12 if SSA listed any of the Veterans’ children as an SSI claimant in Part\nI of\nSSA Form L1103\n.  Otherwise, go no further.\n16\nDetermine the difference between the results of the calculations described in Steps 7 and 13.\nDivide the difference by the number of children that were\nnot\nreceiving an apportionment during the time period SSA specified.\nDrop any fraction of a cent from the result of the calculations.\n17\nGo no further\nafter\nfollowing the instructions in the table below for determining each child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nImportant\n:\nIf VA apportioned benefits to a child during the time period SSA specified, do\nnot\nconsider the child a dependent for the purpose of this step.\nIf the Veterans had …\nThen ...\nonly one child\nsubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 16 from the result of the calculations described in Step 6.  The difference represents the child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nmultiple children\nsubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 16 from the result of the calculation described in Step 9.  (The difference represents each child’s VA income for SSA purposes.)\n18\nUse the pension\nrate table\nthat covers the time period SSA specified to determine what the Veterans’ MAPR would have been during the same time period if\nneither\nwere housebound\nnor\nin need of A&A.\nExample\n:  Using the rate table in effect on December 1, 2022, the MAPR for a Veteran and Veteran-spouse with two children is $26,487.00.\nImportant\n:  If VA apportioned benefits to a child during the time period SSA specified, do\nnot\nconsider the child a dependent for the purpose of this step.\n19\nDivide by 12 the difference between the MAPRs identified in Steps 3 and 18.\nDrop any fraction of a cent from the result of the calculation.\nExample\n:  Using the examples provided in Steps 3 and 18, the result of the calculations described in this step would be $461.33.\n20\nIs the result of the calculations described in Step 19 greater than or equal to the result of the calculation described in Step 7?\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 23.\nIf\nyes\n, both Veterans’ VA income for SSA purposes is $0.00.  Go to the next step if SSA listed any of the Veterans’ children as an SSI claimant in Part I of\nSSA Form L1103\n.  Otherwise, go no further.\n21\nDetermine the difference between the results of the calculations described in Steps 7 and 19.\nDivide the difference by the number of children that were\nnot\nreceiving an apportionment during the time period SSA specified.\nDrop any fraction of a cent from the result of the calculations.\n22\nGo no further\nafter\nfollowing the instructions in the table below for determining each child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nImportant\n:  If VA apportioned benefits to a child during the time period SSA specified, do\nnot\nconsider the child a dependent for the purpose of this step.\nIf the Veterans had …\nThen ...\nonly one child\nsubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 21 from the result of the calculation described in Step 6.  The difference represents the child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nmultiple children\nsubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 21 from the result of the calculation described in Step 9.  The difference represents each child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\n23\nDid UMEs have any impact on the Veterans’ rate of payment during the time period SSA specified?\nIf\nyes\n, go to Step 25.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n24\nSubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 19 from the result of the calculation described in Step 7.\nDivide the difference into equal halves and drop any fraction of a cent from each half.  One of the halves represents one Veteran’s VA income for SSA purposes, while the other half represents the other Veteran’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nReturn to Step 12 if SSA listed any of the Veterans’ children as an SSI claimant in Part I of\nSSA Form L1103\n.  Otherwise, go no further.\n25\nDivide by 12 the difference between\nthe Veterans’ IVAP\nbefore\nVA took into account their UMEs, and\nthe Veterans’ IVAP\nafter\nVA took into account their UMEs.\nDrop any fraction of a cent from the result of the calculation.\n26\nSubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 19 from the result of the calculation described in Step 7.\n27\nIs the result of the calculation described in Step 25 greater than or equal to the result of the calculation described in Step 26?\nIf\nno\n, go to Step 30.\nIf\nyes\n, both Veterans’ VA income for SSA purposes is $0.00.  Go to the next step if SSA listed any of the Veterans’ children as an SSI claimant in Part I of\nSSA Form L1103\n.  Otherwise, go no further.\n28\nDetermine the difference between the results of the calculations described in Steps 25 and 26.\nDivide the difference by the number of children that were\nnot\nreceiving an apportionment during the time period SSA specified.\nDrop any fraction of a cent from the result of the calculations.\n29\nGo no further\nafter\nfollowing the instructions in the table below for determining each child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nImportant\n:\nIf VA apportioned benefits to a child during the time period SSA specified, do\nnot\nconsider the child a dependent for the purpose of this step.\nIf the Veterans had …\nThen ...\nonly one child\nsubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 28 from the result of the calculation described in Step 6.  The difference represents the child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nmultiple children\nsubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 28 from the result of the calculation described in Step 9.  The difference represents each child’s VA income for SSA purposes.\n30\nSubtract the result of the calculations described in Step 25 from the result of the calculation described in Step 26.\nDivide the difference into equal halves and drop any fraction of a cent from each half.  One of the halves represents one Veteran’s VA income for SSA purposes, while the other half represents the other Veteran’s VA income for SSA purposes.\nReturn to Step 12 if SSA listed any of the Veterans’ children as an SSI claimant in Part I of\nSSA Form L1103\n.",
