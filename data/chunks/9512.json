Proper in-service tooth extraction does not constitute service trauma as indicated in\nNielson v. Shinseki\n, 607 F.3d 802 (Fed. Cir, 2010).\nReferences\n: Â For more information on\nservice dental trauma, see\nVAOPGCPREC 5-1997\nconditions that can be SC only for treatment purposes, see\nM21-1, Part XIII, Subpart i, 4.C.1.f\n, and\ntooth numbering systems, see\nM21-1, Part XIII, Subpart i, 4.C.1.m\n.",
