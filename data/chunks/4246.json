Leave the EP 298 running and defer action until the new AEW is generated. When the new AEW is generated,\nclear the corresponding 840 work item, and\nprocess the AEW under the pending EP 298.\n2\nIf the earliest entitlement month displayed on an AEW is\nprior\nto November 2009, check for an out-of-system CRSC/CRDP payment.\nRationale\n:  VA made out-of-system CRSC/CRDP payments from October 2006 through November 2009. If the corporate record was never updated to reflect the payment, the potential for duplicate payments exists.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nidentifying out-of-system CRSC/CRDP payments, see the\nAEW Job Aid\n, and\nprocessing an AEW after VA made an out-of-system CRSC/CRDP payment, see\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart ii, 4.E.1.g\nand\nh\n.\n3\nDoes the withholding in the corporate record exist\nsolely\nto offset the Veteran’s receipt of MRP?\nIf\nyes\n,\ndisregard the remaining step in this table, and\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart ii, 4.E.1.g\n.\nIf\nno\n, go to the next step.\n4\nFollow the instructions in the table below.\nIf VA is withholding compensation …\nThen …\nfor a reason other than to offset the Veteran’s receipt of MRP for all of the entitlement months the AEW covers\ndo\nnot\nrelease the withholding\nclear the EP 298, and\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart ii, 4.E.1.r\n, for providing notice that the Veteran is not entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits.\nfor a reason other than to offset the Veteran’s receipt of MRP for some but not all of the entitlement months covered by the AEW\ndo\nnot\nrelease the withholding for those months during which VA withheld compensation for a reason other than to offset the Veteran’s receipt of MRP, and\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart ii, 4.E.1.r\n, for notifying the Veteran.\nImportant\n:  When preparing the decision notice, select\nThe amounts the VA withheld for reasons other than retired pay\noption in Step 5 of the AEW Assistant.\nboth to offset the Veteran’s receipt of MRP and for another reason during the same month\nrelease that part of the withholding that is to offset the Veteran’s receipt of MRP up to the amount in the\nDue From VA\ncolumn of the AEW for that month, and\nfollow the instructions in\nM21-1, Part VI, Subpart ii, 4.E.1.r\n, for notifying the Veteran.\nImportant\n:  When preparing the decision notice, select\nThe amounts the VA withheld for reasons other than retired pay\noption in Step 5 of the AEW Assistant.\nNote\n:  An AEW may include entitlement months during which a Veteran was not eligible for CRSC/CRDP (such as when a Veteran’s combined disability rating is less than 50 percent).  DFAS and the Coast Guard include these entitlements months on the AEW when they determine VA erroneously withheld compensation based on the Veteran’s receipt of MRP for those months, regardless of the Veteran’s eligibility for CRSC/CRDP.  Accordingly, the amounts in the\nDue From VA\ncolumn of the AEW for those months are valid and should be treated the same as the amounts in the\nDue From VA\ncolumn of the AEW for time periods during which the Veteran is eligible for CRSC/CRDP.",
