Gober\n, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed.Cir. 2000) held that VA, in deciding whether the presumption of aggravation of a condition during combat has been rebutted, must consider a Veteran’s entire medical history, to include any lengthy period without medical complaint during and after service.  VA must consider all relevant factors, to include\navailability of medical records\nnature and course of the disease or disability, and\namount of time that elapsed since military service.\nImportant\n:  Do not merely dismiss the presence of disability because there is an absence of accompanying medical treatment records.  The absence of treatment records does not necessarily mean the absence of disability.  Moreover the absence of medical records during combat conditions does not necessarily establish the absence of disability.\nReference\n:  For more information on aggravation of a pre-existing disability during combat conditions, see\n38 CFR 3.306(b)(2)\n, and\nJensen v. Brown\n, 19 F.3d 1413 (Fed.Cir. 1994).",
