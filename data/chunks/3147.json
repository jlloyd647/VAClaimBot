SC (PTE INC)\n5000\nOsteomyelitis, right tibia, inactive\n20% from 7-21-96\n10% from 4-8-05\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nassigning historical evaluations for osteomyelitis, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.D.1.a\nand\nb\n, and\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5000, Note 2\n, and\ndetermining whether recurrent episodes of osteomyelitis have occurred, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.D.1.b\n.",
