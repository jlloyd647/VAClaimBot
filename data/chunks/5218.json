Wilkie\n, 975 F. 3d 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2020), a domestic relations separation agreement sanctioned by a State court by a judgment of separation plays no role in VA’s determination of entitlement to special apportionment.\nVA may\nnot\napportion a surviving spouse’s current-law Survivors Pension to a child that is not in the surviving spouse’s custody.  (The child, in this case, might be entitled to Survivors Pension in their own right.)\nThe policy described in the previous bullet does\nnot\napply if the surviving spouse is receiving Section 306 or Old Law survivors pension.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\napportioning benefits to a dependent that is not on the beneficiary’s award, see\nM21-1, Part VII, Subpart iii, 1.A.1.c\n, and\nspecial apportionments, see\n38 CFR 3.451\n.",
