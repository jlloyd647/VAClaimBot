Wilkie on Determinations Regarding Functional Impairment of Earning Capacity\nThe Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC), in\nMartinez-Bodon v. Wilkie\n, 32 Vet.App. 393 (2020), defined a disability under\n38 U.S.C. 1110\nas including any condition that results in a functional impairment of earning capacity.  CAVC clarified that this applies more broadly than to just pain.\nCAVC, in\nMartinez-Boden\n, also held that a psychiatric condition must have a\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n, fifth version (DSM-5) diagnosis to constitute a disability, as\n38 CFR 4.125\nand\n38 CFR 4.130\ncontain a DSM-5 diagnosis requirement for claimed psychiatric conditions.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed this holding in\nMartinez-Bodon v. McDonough\n, 28 F.4th 1241 (2022).\nThe\nMartinez-Bodon\nholding is not a liberalizing rule warranting application of\n38 CFR 3.114\n.\nThe\nMartinez-Bodon\nholding is dated August 11, 2020, and applies to all claims or legacy appeals pending or received on or after that date.",
