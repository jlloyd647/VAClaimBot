Gober\n, 10 Vet.App. 343 (1997), the phrase \"date entitlement arose\" was found to be similar to the phrase \"facts found.\"  This case, along with the regulatory context, strongly suggest that the\ndate entitlement arose\nis the date on which the facts in the case demonstrate that the entitling criteria are first met.",
