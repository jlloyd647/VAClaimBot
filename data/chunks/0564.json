Secretary of Veterans Affairs\n, No. 19-1600 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the court invalidated this portion of VA’s regulation.  This means an ITF may now be applied to supplemental claims that are not finally adjudicated on or after July 30, 2021.\nReferences\n:  For more information on\nancillary benefits, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.2.a and b\nITFs and supplemental claims, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 2.A.2.b\n, and\nITFs and continuous pursuit in supplemental claims, see\nM21-1, Part X.
